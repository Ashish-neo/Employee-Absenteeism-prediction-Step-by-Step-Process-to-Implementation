About Dataset
What to Expect from the Following Sections?

• Data Preprocessing: First, we will preprocess the data. We devote a significant amount of time to this step as it is a crucial part of every analytical task. We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.

• Machine Learning: This section will incorporate the work we did in the preprocessing part into the code necessary for making the next step. Namely, to develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work. For our case study, this will be a logistic regression model. Numerous machine learning tools and techniques will help us at this stage. At the end, we will store our work as a Python module that we will call ‘absenteeism_module’ and will thus preserve it in a form suitable for further analysis.

• Loading the ‘absenteeismmodule’: In this section we will load the ‘absenteeismmodule’ and use its methods to obtain predictions.
